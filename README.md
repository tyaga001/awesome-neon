[Neon](https://neon.tech) is an awesome database you love. It's a serverless platform designed to help you build reliable and scalable applications faster.

# 3 Things to Remember About Neon:

> üêò **Postgres**: Neon is built on the foundation of Postgres. It supports the same extensions, drivers, and SQL syntax as Postgres, ensuring familiarity and ease of use.
>
> ‚òÅÔ∏è **Serverless**: Neon operates on a serverless model. Your database is represented as a simple URL, and Neon automatically scales up and down based on workload demands. Say goodbye to overprovisioning!
>
> üå± **Branching**: Just like version control for code, Neon allows you to create instant, isolated copies of your data. This feature is invaluable for development, testing, and maintaining separate environments.
